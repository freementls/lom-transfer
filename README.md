# Power Sweeper

Normalize and clean Power Apps canvas `.msapp` files with an ordered **hop** pipeline.

Drop an app, choose operations (or load a profile preset), reorder the sequence, run, then download the cleaned `.msapp` and a change report.

## Local path

Canonical install: **`/srv/http/power_sweeper`** (same layout as sweeper/convert under `/srv/http`).

## Quick start

`vendor/` is included in the tree, so **Composer is not required** to run the app.

```bash
cd /srv/http/power_sweeper
php -S localhost:8080 router.php   # optional; or use Apache below
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

With Apache serving `/srv/http` (like convert/sweeper), use [http://localhost/power_sweeper/](http://localhost/power_sweeper/) — root `index.php` + `assets/` are the entry points.

If you change PHP dependencies later and have Composer:

```bash
composer install
```
## How it works

1. Upload an `.msapp` (ZIP archive of canvas sources).
2. Build a hop sequence — or pick a **profile** to fill one.
3. Power Sweeper unpacks the archive, edits `Src/**/*.pa.yaml` (and control JSON when present), repacks, and returns the file plus a report.

Order matters: the same hops in a different sequence can produce different results.

## Built-in hops

| Hop | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `normalize_containers` | Clear default drop shadow, border, radius, and padding on containers |
| `accessibility_labels` | Fill missing `AccessibleLabel` from Text / Tooltip / name |
| `align_near_miss` | Snap sibling X/Y/Width/Height values off by a few pixels |
| `strip_default_fill` | Clear opaque white container fills |
| `normalize_classic_button_chrome` | Clear Hover/Pressed fills when Fill is already transparent |
| `tooltip_from_label` | Copy Text / AccessibleLabel into empty Tooltip |

## Profiles

PHP files in [`profiles/`](profiles/) return a description and ordered hop list (same idea as sweeper profiles). Examples: `default`, `containers_only`, `a11y_pass`, `transparent_buttons`.

## Tests

```bash
php tests/run_tests.php
```

## Notes

- Open the cleaned `.msapp` in Power Apps Studio (**File → Open → Browse**) and save once after import.
- Only hop-owned properties are changed; media, connections, and unrelated metadata are left alone.
- Prefer editing apps you can re-save in Studio; treat this as a companion cleanup tool, not a full source-control substitute.
